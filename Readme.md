This is a template for a NodeJS server with ReactJS and TypeORM or Sequelize ORM for SQL databases.

To use this template:

1. First take a look at src/pre-start/env, and add your environment variables for both production and development

2. Check the scripts inside the package.json file, they are self explanatory.

3. Inside the views folder is the React app that when built is used by the Node server as a front end

4. The React app uses Material-UI and has a theme component that you can change.

5. Use the generators for the database entities.
